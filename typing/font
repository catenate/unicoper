Unicode provides a large collection of mathematical operators; these can
be found in the code tables¹ Mathematical Operators, Miscellaneous Math
Symbols-A, Miscellaneous Math Symbols-B, and Supplemental Math
Operators.  Support for the full collection of symbols is not widespread
yet, but three fonts offer good coverage:
 ¹ http://www.unicode.org/charts/

	Code2000: many characters, shareware ($5)
	http://www.code2000.net/code2000_page.htm
	
	Everson Mono: monowidth, shareware (€25 for 3 computers)
	http://www.evertype.com/emono/
	
	Stix fonts: comprehensive, integrated with TeX, probably released later this year
	http://www.stixfonts.org/
