Sargent, M. 20100310.  Unicode nearly plain text encoding of
mathematics, v3.  Unicode technical note 28.
http://unicode.org/notes/tn28/UTN28-PlainTextMath-v3.pdf

With a few conventions, Unicode can encode many mathematical expressions in
readable nearly plain text.  Technically this format is a “lightly marked
up format”; hence the use of “nearly”.  The format is linear, but it can be
displayed in built-up presentation form.  … Most mathematical expressions
can be represented unambiguously in the linear format, from which they can
be exported to [La]TeX, MathML, C++, and symbolic manipulation programs.
The linear format borrows notation from TeX for mathematical objects that
don’t lend themselves well to a mathematical linear notation, e.g., for
matrices.  A variety of syntax choices can be used for a linear format.
The choices made in this paper favor a number of criteria: efficient input
of mathematical formulae, sufficient generality to support high-quality
mathematical typography, the ability to round trip elegant mathematical
text at least in a rich-text environment, and a format that resembles a
real mathematical notation.  Obviously compromises between these goals had
to be made.  The linear format is useful for 1) inputting mathematical
expressions,6 2) displaying mathematics by text engines that cannot display
a built-up format, and 3) computer programs.  For more general storage and
interchange of math expressions between math-aware programs, MathML and
other higher-level languages are preferred.
