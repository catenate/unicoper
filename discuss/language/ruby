nb ruby unicode relation set wishlist
Berger, D. -20070119.  Allowing Unicode in the grammar?  Ruby forum:
Ruby core.
http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/94710

Daniel Berger: If I had an initial wishlist, I would keep it small:

	≡ (U+2261)
	≥ (U+2265)
	≤ (U+2264)
	≠ (U+2260)

I'm not suggesting replacing '==', just allowing the Unicode code point
to mean the same thing (and thus, allowing us to define it in our own
classes as well).

Nikolai Weibull: It'd be really cool to be able to define additional
operators at runtime (a patch for this was sent to ruby-talk a while ago
(2005?), but it never really went anywhere), so that Set could take
operators like ∉, ⊆, and ⊃.  It's pushing it a bit, but I'd really
appreciate being able to write stuff like

	puts n if n ∈ (1..100)
