Zakhlestin, A.  20070726.  Unicode vs.  programming languages.
Alexey Zakhlestin’s blog: Programming for mac and web.

I really-really want to see a programming language, which allows using
proper unicode symbols for operators.  I mean:

	· instead of *
	→ instead of ->
	← instead if <-
	≠ instrad of !=
	≤ and ≥ instead of <= and >=

This list can be continued more and more… I perfectly understand the
roots of current situation and I don’t ask to use ONLY unicode-symbols,
but I ask language-manufacturers to allow this.
