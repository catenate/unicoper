Equal: =? or ≟

To test equality of two values, == is not intuitive: its symbols do not
include one connoting test, variability, or questioning.  == is unique
to programming languages: Unicode has no double-equals sign.
=? includes both equality (=) and test (?) symbols, so better encodes
both concepts.  ≟ (questioned equal to) is the corresponding single-
character option for font sizes large enough to legibly display the
question mark.
