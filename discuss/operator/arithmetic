Exponentiation

Exponentiation offers a variety of symbols.  ^ suffers from confusion
with bitwise exclusive-or.  ^^ implies multiple operations, so does not
scale well to actual repeated exponentiation.  ** also does not scale well,
but reminds one of multiplication, but only in programming languages,
since mathematicians do not denote scalar multiplication with * outside
of programming languages.  Several languages offer a named function,
usually pow for power, but since it takes options and might need
qualified with a library name it is not usually succinct.  I prefer
↑ (up arrow), which scales well in Knuth’s up-arrow notation.¹

Integer exponent: ↥
Real exponent: ↑

To represent exponentiation with only integer exponents, we use ↥,
up arrow with lower horizontal bar, in style of floor-function¹ notation.
Real exponentiation ↑, up arrow, has no lower horizontal bar.
