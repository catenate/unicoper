Bitwise and: ∧
Bitwise or: ∨

We treat bitwise operators are treated similarly to logical ones:
instead of & and |, we suggest ∧ (logical and) and ∨ (logical or).


Bitwise exclusive-or: ⊻

For bitwise exclusive-or, the commonly-used symbol ^ looks more like ∧
(and) than ∨ (or), which seems misleading, and does not encode exclusivity,
as ⊻ (xor) does.
