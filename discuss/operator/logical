Boolean

For Boolean logical-and and logical-or, && and || are unique to
programming languages, so I prefer the forms ⋀ (n-ary logical and)
and ⋁ (n-ary logical or).  


Logical and: ⋀

Reserve ∧ for bitwise operations, after the weight of ⊻, so use ⋀ for
logical-and.

Logical or: ⋁

Reserve ∨ for bitwise operations, after the weight of ⊻, so use ⋁ for
logical-or.
