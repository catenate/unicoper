Floor function
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_function

Gauss introduced the square bracket notation [x] for the floor function
in his third proof of quadratic reciprocity (1808).  This remained the
standard in mathematics until Iverson introduced the names "floor" and
"ceiling" and the corresponding notations ⌊x⌋ and ⌈x⌉ in his 1962 book
/A Programming Language/.  Both notations are now used in mathematics;
this article follows Iverson.  ….  The floor and ceiling function are
usually typeset with left and right square brackets where the upper (for
floor function) or lower (for ceiling function) horizontal bars are missing….¹


Knuth’s up-arrow notation
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth's_up-arrow_notation

In expressions such as a^{b}, the notation for exponentiation is
usually to write the exponent b as a superscript to the base number a.
But many environments—such as programming languages and plain-text
e-mail—do not support such two-dimensional layout.  People have adopted
the linear notation a↑b for such environments; the up-arrow suggests
'raising to the power of'.  If the character set doesn't contain an up
arrow, the caret ^ is used instead.  The superscript notation a^{b}
doesn't lend itself well to generalization, which explains why Knuth
chose to work from the inline notation a↑b instead.

To extend the sequence of operations beyond exponentiation, Knuth
defined a “double arrow” operator to denote iterated exponentiation
(tetration).  ….  Here and below evaluation is to take place from right
to left, as Knuth's arrow operators (just like exponentiation) are
defined to be right-associative.

This already leads to some fairly large numbers, but Knuth extended the
notation.  He went on to define a “triple arrow” operator a↑↑↑b for
iterated application of the “double arrow” operator (also known as
pentation), followed by a 'quad arrow' operator a↑↑↑↑b, and so on.
The general rule is that an n-arrow operator expands into a right-
associative series of (n−1)-arrow operators.  ….  The notation "a ↑n b"
is commonly used to denote a↑↑…↑b with n arrows.


Logical conjunction
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction

And is usually expressed with an infix operator.  In mathematics and
logic, it is usually ∧; in electronics ·; and in programming languages,
& or and.  Some programming languages have a related control structure,
the short-circuit and, written &&, and then, etc.


Logical disjunction
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction

Or is usually expressed with an infix operator.  In mathematics and
logic, it is usually ∨; in electronics, +; and in programming languages,
| or or.  Some programming languages have a related control structure,
the short-circuit or, written ||, or else, etc.


Minus: Character codes
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minus#Character_codes

The Unicode minus sign − is designed to be the same length and height as
the plus and equals signs.  In most fonts these are the same width as
digits in order to facilitate the alignment of numbers in tables.
The hyphen-minus sign (-) is the ASCII version of the minus sign, and
doubles as a hyphen.  It is usually shorter in length than the plus sign
and sometimes at a different height.  It can be used as a substitute for
the true minus sign when the character set is limited to ASCII.


Multiply: Notation and terminology
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiply#Notation_and_terminology

Multiplication is often written using the multiplication sign "×" … in
infix notation.  ….  Multiplication is sometimes denoted by either a
middle dot "·" or a period.  ….  The asterisk (as in 5*2) is often used
in programming languages because it appears on every keyboard ….
This usage originated in the FORTRAN programming language.


Obelus
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelus

The obelus ÷ was first used as a symbol for division in 1659 in the algebra
book /Teutsche Algebra/ by Johann Rahn.  Some think that John Pell, who
edited the book, may have been responsible for this use of the symbol.
The obelus had been used by some writers to represent subtraction,
and that usage continued in some parts of Europe (including Norway and,
until fairly recently, Denmark).  ….  The obelus is used primarily as a
symbol for division (as on a calculator) and as an operator in
elementary arithmetic.  ….  In the Unicode character set, the obelus is
known as the “division sign” and has the code point U+00F7.


Relational operator
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_operator

This usage of "=" in these "C-syntax" languages can lead to coding errors.
A programmer may mistype "if (x = y)" instead of "if (x == y)".
In C, the former code fragment roughly means "assign y to x, and if the
new value of x is not zero, execute the statement following".
The latter code fragment roughly means "if and only if x is equal to y,
execute the statement following".

In print ≠, meaning not equal to, tests the negated equivalence of two values.

In print ≥, meaning greater than or equal to, tests if the value of the
left expression is greater than or equal to that of the right.

In print ≤, meaning less than or equal to, tests if the value of the
left expression is less than or equal to that of the right.
