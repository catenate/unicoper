For Boolean logical-and and logical-or, && and || are unique to
programming languages, so I prefer the forms ⋀ (n-ary logical and)
and ⋁ (n-ary logical or).  


Logical and: ⋀

Reserve ∧ for bitwise operations, after the weight of ⊻, so use ⋀ for
logical-and.

And is usually expressed with an infix operator.  In mathematics and
logic, it is usually ∧; in electronics ·; and in programming languages,
& or and.  Some programming languages have a related control structure,
the short-circuit and, written &&, and then, etc.¹

Logical or: ⋁

Reserve ∨ for bitwise operations, after the weight of ⊻, so use ⋁ for
logical-or.

Or is usually expressed with an infix operator.  In mathematics and
logic, it is usually ∨; in electronics, +; and in programming languages,
| or or.  Some programming languages have a related control structure,
the short-circuit or, written ||, or else, etc.¹
