Subtract: −

The Unicode minus sign − is designed to be the same length and height as
the plus and equals signs.  In most fonts these are the same width as
digits in order to facilitate the alignment of numbers in tables.
The hyphen-minus sign (-) is the ASCII version of the minus sign, and
doubles as a hyphen.  It is usually shorter in length than the plus sign
and sometimes at a different height.  It can be used as a substitute for
the true minus sign when the character set is limited to ASCII.¹

Multiply: × or ·

Multiplication is often written using the multiplication sign "×" … in
infix notation.  ….  Multiplication is sometimes denoted by either a
middle dot "·" or a period.  ….  The asterisk (as in 5*2) is often used
in programming languages because it appears on every keyboard ….
This usage originated in the FORTRAN programming language.¹

Divide: ÷

The obelus ÷ was first used as a symbol for division in 1659 in the algebra
book /Teutsche Algebra/ by Johann Rahn.  Some think that John Pell, who
edited the book, may have been responsible for this use of the symbol.
The obelus had been used by some writers to represent subtraction,
and that usage continued in some parts of Europe (including Norway and,
until fairly recently, Denmark).  ….  The obelus is used primarily as a
symbol for division (as on a calculator) and as an operator in
elementary arithmetic.  ….  In the Unicode character set, the obelus is
known as the “division sign” and has the code point U+00F7.¹

Exponentiation

Exponentiaton offers a variety of symbols. ^ suffers from confusion
with bitwise exclusive-or. ^^ implies multiple operations, so does
not scale well to actual repeated exponentiation. ** also does not
scale well, but reminds one of multiplication, but only in programming
languages, since mathematicians do not denote multiplication with *
outside of programming languages. Several languages offer a named
function, usually pow for power, but since it takes options and might
need qualified with a library name it is not usually succinct. I prefer
↑ (up arrow), which scales well with Knuth’s up-arrow notation.

From Wikipedia's presentation of Knuth’s up-arrow notation:¹
 ¹ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth's_up-arrow_notation

“In expressions such as a^{b}, the notation for exponentiation is
usually to write the exponent b as a superscript to the base number a.
But many environments—such as programming languages and plain-text
e-mail—do not support such two-dimensional layout.  People have adopted
the linear notation a↑b for such environments; the up-arrow suggests
'raising to the power of'.  If the character set doesn't contain an up
arrow, the caret ^ is used instead.  The superscript notation a^{b}
doesn't lend itself well to generalization, which explains why Knuth
chose to work from the inline notation a↑b instead.

“To extend the sequence of operations beyond exponentiation, Knuth
defined a “double arrow” operator to denote iterated exponentiation
(tetration).  ….  Here and below evaluation is to take place from right
to left, as Knuth's arrow operators (just like exponentiation) are
defined to be right-associative.

“This already leads to some fairly large numbers, but Knuth extended the
notation.  He went on to define a “triple arrow” operator a↑↑↑b for
iterated application of the “double arrow” operator (also known as
pentation), followed by a 'quad arrow' operator a↑↑↑↑b, and so on.
The general rule is that an n-arrow operator expands into a right-
associative series of (n−1)-arrow operators.  ….  The notation "a ↑n b"
is commonly used to denote a↑↑…↑b with n arrows.”


Integer exponent: ↥
Real exponent: ↑

To represent exponentiation with only integer exponents, we use ↥,
up-arrow with lower horizontal bar, in style of floor-function notation.
Real exponentiation ↑ has no lower horizontal bar.

Gauss introduced the square bracket notation [x] for the floor function
in his third proof of quadratic reciprocity (1808).  This remained the
standard in mathematics until Iverson introduced the names "floor" and
"ceiling" and the corresponding notations ⌊x⌋ and ⌈x⌉ in his 1962 book
/A Programming Language/.  Both notations are now used in mathematics;
this article follows Iverson.  ….  The floor and ceiling function are
usually typeset with left and right square brackets where the upper (for
floor function) or lower (for ceiling function) horizontal bars are missing….¹
