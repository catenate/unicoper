For beauty, lexers should accept (not mandate) Unicode and alternative
forms of operators, and translate them to standard forms.  Itâ€™s a shame
that modern programming languages can accept Unicode strings and even
variable names, but cannot accept more pleasant operator forms.

This project discusses corrected, alternative and subjectively-better
operator forms from the C family and languages it influenced,
and provides methods to use them before languages accept them.
